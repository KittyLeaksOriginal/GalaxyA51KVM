Hey, Blaze's Here, So Do not Download the zips i put, ONLY the release, The zip are ONLY FOR DEBUGING, It may brick the Boot and cause Bootloops, Backup the Boot in TWRP or OrangeFox, Both are tested, Made By me and using Only phone the whole time, no pc, flashed multiple Android from 13 to 16 and the only one what worked is Lineage, Hope that help, If u got any issue, don't hesitate to contact me on Discord: blazespirealt
