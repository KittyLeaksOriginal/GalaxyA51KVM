Hello!, So, if you're trying to flash one of the kernels, u can do it, i tested all of the kernel, but no luck, i am still trying to fix Error 1 on twrp and OrangeFox.
If you got any further than Error 1, please contact me on Discord: blazespirealt.
(New Update), I found whats the issues, the issue if you have an error on TWRP or OrangeFox saying:
Failed to mount '/Vendor' or '/odm'/ or '/sdcard'
the issue will be solved.
